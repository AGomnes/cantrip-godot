# Cantrip for Godot

Write cards, statuses, relics, enemies and abilities as `.cantrip` text files, and drive them from one
node, in GDScript or C#. This folder is the addon; the rules engine it uses is a separate .NET library.

Requires **Godot 4.6.x, .NET edition** (tested on 4.6.1 and 4.6.2) and the **.NET SDK 8 or later**,
even for a game written entirely in GDScript. The addon is C# source rather than a DLL, because
Godot resolves scripts by file path inside your project's own assembly.

## Installing

The full install guide, with what to check first and what to expect at each step, is
https://github.com/AGomnes/Cantrip/blob/v0.1.0-preview.5/docs/godot.md. In short:

1. If your project has no C# solution, create one: Project → Tools → C# → Create C# solution.
2. Copy `addons/cantrip/` into your project. Until step 3, a build fails with errors about the
   `Cantrip` namespace; that is expected.
3. Add the rules engine from NuGet, in the folder with your `.csproj`. The version must match this
   addon's, which is also in `plugin.cfg`:
   ```
   dotnet add package Cantrip.Core --version 0.1.0-preview.5
   ```
   Offline, reference the `Cantrip.Core.dll` from the `.nupkg` on the GitHub release instead; the
   guide shows how.
4. **Build the C# project before enabling the plugin**, with the editor's Build button or
   `dotnet build`. Until the assembly exists, Godot cannot load a C# plugin and the addon's nodes
   are missing, with nothing in the log to say why.
5. Enable *Cantrip* in Project Settings → Plugins.
6. Put your `.cantrip` files in `res://content` and add a `CantripRuntime` node to a scene.

## What you get

- A node that loads content, runs battles and hands everything to script as ids and dictionaries.
- A dock with problems (parse errors and lint findings), your content's own tests, description
  previews with live values, and an editor with syntax highlighting that checks what you type and
  saves with Ctrl+S.
- An importer so `.cantrip` files reach an exported build, and an export check that fails a build where
  they would not.
- Two tabs in the debugger: a running game's causality trace, with pause and step, and the entities
  in play.

## Documentation

The guide, https://github.com/AGomnes/Cantrip/blob/v0.1.0-preview.5/docs/godot.md, has a first battle in
GDScript that runs as written, and a reference for every method, signal and dictionary of the node.
Two rules to know before writing any GDScript against it: members keep their C# PascalCase names,
and a C# default argument is not a default in GDScript, so every parameter must be passed.
