# Cantrip for Godot

Write cards, heroes, statuses, relics, enemies and abilities as `.cantrip` text files, and drive
them from one node, in GDScript or C#. Neither cards nor turns are required: a game whose party
stands on a board and uses abilities on cooldowns against waves on a tick clock is the same node
with the piles left out. This folder is the addon; the rules engine it uses is a separate .NET
library.

Requires **Godot 4.6.x, .NET edition** (tested on 4.6.1 and 4.6.2) and the **.NET SDK 8 or later**,
even for a game written entirely in GDScript. The addon is C# source rather than a DLL, because
Godot resolves scripts by file path inside your project's own assembly.

## Installing

The full install guide, with what to check first and what to expect at each step, is
https://github.com/AGomnes/Cantrip/blob/v1.0.0/docs/godot.md. In short:

1. If your project has no C# solution, create one: Project → Tools → C# → Create C# solution.
2. Copy `addons/cantrip/` into your project. Until step 3, a build fails with errors about the
   `Cantrip` namespace; that is expected.
3. Add the rules engine from NuGet, in the folder with your `.csproj`. The version must match this
   addon's, which is also in `plugin.cfg`:
   ```
   dotnet add package Cantrip.Core --version 1.0.0
   ```
   Offline, reference the `Cantrip.Core.dll` from the `.nupkg` on the GitHub release instead; the
   guide shows how.
4. **Build the C# project before enabling the plugin**, with the editor's Build button or
   `dotnet build`. Until the assembly exists, Godot cannot load a C# plugin and the addon's nodes
   are missing, with nothing in the log to say why.
5. Enable *Cantrip* in Project Settings → Plugins.
6. Put your `.cantrip` files in `res://content` and add a `CantripRuntime` node to a scene.

## What you get

- A node that loads content, runs battles and hands everything to script as ids and dictionaries.
  Turns or a real-time clock: `EndTurn` and `Pass` drive turns, a `TickDriver` runs the clock and
  `Tick` advances it by hand, and `IsRealTime` tells a UI that draws both which it is looking at.
- A party on a board. `AddHero`, `GetParty`, `CanAct` and `PlayBy` are for the members a game is
  asked for input for; `GetFallen` and `Revive` are for the ones that went down. `StartBattleOn`
  says which board a fight is on, `Place` says where somebody stands, and every entity comes back
  with its `lane` and `rank`.
- A dock with problems (parse errors and lint findings), your content's own tests, description
  previews with live values, and an editor with syntax highlighting that checks what you type and
  saves with Ctrl+S.
- An importer so `.cantrip` files reach an exported build, and an export check that fails a build where
  they would not.
- Two tabs in the debugger: a running game's causality trace, with pause and step, and the entities
  in play.

## Documentation

The guide, https://github.com/AGomnes/Cantrip/blob/v1.0.0/docs/godot.md, has a first battle in
GDScript that runs as written, and a reference for every method, signal and dictionary of the node.
Two rules to know before writing any GDScript against it: members keep their C# PascalCase names,
and a C# default argument is not a default in GDScript, so every parameter must be passed.

When something goes wrong, https://github.com/AGomnes/Cantrip/blob/v1.0.0/docs/troubleshooting.md#godot
has the Godot half: a `Nonexistent function`, a stale `.godot` folder, content that will not load,
the addon and the library out of step, why the game will not speed up, why a wave of enemies acts in
lockstep, and why everybody ends up standing in one lane.
